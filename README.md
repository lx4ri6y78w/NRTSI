# NRTSI
This is the official repository of the paper "NRTSI: Non-Recurrent Time Series Imputation for Irregularly-sampled Data"

NRTSI is a state-of-the-art time series imputation model that this broadly applicable to regularly-sampled time series, irregularly-sampled time series, time series with partially observed dimensions and time series requiring stochastic imputation.

The figure below shows the power of NRTSI on imputing billiard trajectories with only 5 time points observed.
